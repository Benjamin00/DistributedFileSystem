            Just how different are we from others and how does the society react? Sometimes we do not want to act different out of fear that we will not be accepted. In the story “A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings” by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, we can analyze how the society treats differences. The story comments on how society treats differences by expressing that society has a mixed attitude of tolerance, hostility, and curiosity towards differences. 
            When the very old man with enormous wings first lands at the house, the house owners Pelayo and Elisenda “found him familiar” after they first examine him and allow the old man to stay at the house (1). Because the old man looked so familiar, Pelayo and Elisenda understood that tolerating him would be much easier than tolerating another human of a different demographic or from a different village. This is especially true if we assume that the neighborhood in which the story takes place is isolated or not very open to foreigners. The owners tolerated the winged old man because “did not have the heart to club him to death” and rather saw him as the victim of a disastrous event (1). This implies that Pelayo and Elisenda had enough compassion, which they intended on showing, by tolerating the winged old man’s existence. I think that the reason for allowing him to live and stay in the house was because they wanted to help the old man get back to his place of origin and I do not think that it was out of genuine compassion that motivated the owners to allow him to live with them. The owners are an example of how society can be tolerant of differences.
            Despite how benevolent Pelayo and Elisenda may have seemed at first, society can also become unwelcoming and hostile to any differences. An example of this is when Pelayo and Elisenda decide to “lock him up with the hens in the wire chicken coop” (1). Pelayo and Elisenda would allow him to live but they would not allow him to even set foot in the house, implying that the old man was some type of animal that belonged with the other hens. Pelayo and Elisenda, who are part of the society, play into only some part of how society treats differences. In fact, the real hostility towards differences begins when the entire village and people from all over get involved with the old man. The people from the village and all over tossed “him things to eat through the opening in the wire as if he weren’t a supernatural creature but a circus animal” (1). Even though this example from the story may not directly imply that there is a hatred towards differences, it is implied that people enjoy mistreating the old man because the people are enjoying throwing food to the old man. Through this joy, hatred for differences can arise because a few people will start to get feelings of contempt as an opposing reaction to the joy that everyone else is getting from feeding the old man and will decide to throw food out of hostility and hatred. This hatred can quickly spread among the crowd of spectators.  Another example of hostility towards differences being showed in the story is when “even the most merciful threw stones at” the winged old man (2). The fact that even the most well behaved were willing to throw stones at the fantastical character who is very different proves that even the most well behaved in society have moments when they cannot tolerate any differences. To put it simply, when all the spectators were throwing stones, most of them did it out of hostility. In fact, we can interpret the throwing of any object as an act of hostility. 
            Finally, society can treat differences with curiosity. After all, why would curious people come “from far away” to see the supernatural creature in order to satisfy their curiosity (2)? The people who came from all over each had their own differences that they did not care or know about. The people who came to see the winged old man were as different as “a poor woman who since childhood has been counting her heartbeats and had run out of numbers” from “a Portuguese man who couldn’t sleep because the noise of the stars disturbed him” from “a sleepwalker who got up at night to undo the things he had done while awake.” (2). These people who originated from different parts of the world and from different circumstances had only one thing in common which was their curiosity about and interest in seeing the winged old man. So, we can see here that reacting to differences with curiosity is universal not limited to one specific group.  
            Using numerous examples from the story, we can see that the author is trying to get us to understand that society reacts to differences with a mixed attitude involving both positive and negative feelings. 
 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 

            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story.

            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat.

When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws.

We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects.

            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator.

As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.

We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2).

Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces.

The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space.

The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator.

The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.

We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2).

Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces.

The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space.

The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator.

The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.

We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2).

Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces.

The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space.

The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator.

The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.

We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2).

Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces.

The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space.

The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator.

The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.

We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2).

Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces.

The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space.

The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator.

The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.

We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2).

Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces.

The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space.

The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator.

The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.

We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2).

Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author.

Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village.

If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill.

            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731).

Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village.

If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill.

            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731).

Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village.

If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill.

            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731).

Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village.

If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill.

            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731).

Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village.

If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill.

            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731).

Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village.

If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill.

            Just how different are we from others and how does the society react? Sometimes we do not want to act different out of fear that we will not be accepted. In the story “A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings” by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, we can analyze how the society treats differences. The story comments on how society treats differences by expressing that society has a mixed attitude of tolerance, hostility, and curiosity towards differences. 
            When the very old man with enormous wings first lands at the house, the house owners Pelayo and Elisenda “found him familiar” after they first examine him and allow the old man to stay at the house (1). Because the old man looked so familiar, Pelayo and Elisenda understood that tolerating him would be much easier than tolerating another human of a different demographic or from a different village. This is especially true if we assume that the neighborhood in which the story takes place is isolated or not very open to foreigners. The owners tolerated the winged old man because “did not have the heart to club him to death” and rather saw him as the victim of a disastrous event (1). This implies that Pelayo and Elisenda had enough compassion, which they intended on showing, by tolerating the winged old man’s existence. I think that the reason for allowing him to live and stay in the house was because they wanted to help the old man get back to his place of origin and I do not think that it was out of genuine compassion that motivated the owners to allow him to live with them. The owners are an example of how society can be tolerant of differences.
            Despite how benevolent Pelayo and Elisenda may have seemed at first, society can also become unwelcoming and hostile to any differences. An example of this is when Pelayo and Elisenda decide to “lock him up with the hens in the wire chicken coop” (1). Pelayo and Elisenda would allow him to live but they would not allow him to even set foot in the house, implying that the old man was some type of animal that belonged with the other hens. Pelayo and Elisenda, who are part of the society, play into only some part of how society treats differences. In fact, the real hostility towards differences begins when the entire village and people from all over get involved with the old man. The people from the village and all over tossed “him things to eat through the opening in the wire as if he weren’t a supernatural creature but a circus animal” (1). Even though this example from the story may not directly imply that there is a hatred towards differences, it is implied that people enjoy mistreating the old man because the people are enjoying throwing food to the old man. Through this joy, hatred for differences can arise because a few people will start to get feelings of contempt as an opposing reaction to the joy that everyone else is getting from feeding the old man and will decide to throw food out of hostility and hatred. This hatred can quickly spread among the crowd of spectators.  Another example of hostility towards differences being showed in the story is when “even the most merciful threw stones at” the winged old man (2). The fact that even the most well behaved were willing to throw stones at the fantastical character who is very different proves that even the most well behaved in society have moments when they cannot tolerate any differences. To put it simply, when all the spectators were throwing stones, most of them did it out of hostility. In fact, we can interpret the throwing of any object as an act of hostility. 
            Finally, society can treat differences with curiosity. After all, why would curious people come “from far away” to see the supernatural creature in order to satisfy their curiosity (2)? The people who came from all over each had their own differences that they did not care or know about. The people who came to see the winged old man were as different as “a poor woman who since childhood has been counting her heartbeats and had run out of numbers” from “a Portuguese man who couldn’t sleep because the noise of the stars disturbed him” from “a sleepwalker who got up at night to undo the things he had done while awake.” (2). These people who originated from different parts of the world and from different circumstances had only one thing in common which was their curiosity about and interest in seeing the winged old man. So, we can see here that reacting to differences with curiosity is universal not limited to one specific group.  
            Using numerous examples from the story, we can see that the author is trying to get us to understand that society reacts to differences with a mixed attitude involving both positive and negative feelings.

            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story.

The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real.

From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space.

If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5).

His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1).

Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story.

This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go.

The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space.

The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible.

With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1).

Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story.

This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go.

The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space.

The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible.

With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1).

Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story.

This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go.

The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space.

The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible.

With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1).

Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story.

This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go.

The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space.

The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible.

With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1).

Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story.

This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go.

The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space.

The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible.

With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1).

Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story.

This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go.

The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space.

The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible.

With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1).

Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story.

This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space. The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go.

The narrator’s sister’s room had her school “uniform hanging in the closet” (3) and a calendar that “was left at the month she died, as if time had frozen solid at that point” (3). From these descriptions, we know that the uniform was enclosed by the closet and that the calendar was symbolically limited to a certain point in time. The calendar was neither on any month prior to his sister’s death nor was it on any month after his sister’s death. The calendar says nothing about the past nor the future, leaving it confined to the month of his sister’s death.   
            Confined spaces also indicate adventure and curiosity. As you would already know, the narrator recalls a memory from a wind cave in which his sister goes down a hole that our narrator is too big for. The narrator’s sister goes down the hole out of curiosity. When she comes out of the hole, she tells our narrator that all the made-up characters from “Alice in Wonderland” were real. The narrator’s sister told our narrator that “’It wasn’t made up.’” (11). The narrator could only take his sister’s word for it, as she was the only one who knew what existed inside the confined space that is represented by the hole. This talk of magical characters was the only thing that the narrator would hear about in small spaces that he could not go. After a few years, the narrator starts to think that what his sister told him “in that wind cave was indeed true.” (12) and that “they all really exist” (12). This implies that there was something of a magical existence within small spaces from our narrator’s perspective. As a result, confined spaces also had the effect of arousing the curiosity of our narrator. 
            As you can see, the idea of enclosed spaces can be found throughout the story and have had a variety of effects on the narrator. The mixing of these attitudes would evolve into the present-day narrator’s attitude towards confined spaces or the attitude the narrator had towards confined spaces as of the time he is telling us the story. 
            Closed spaces can be uncomfortable to deal with especially if you suffer from claustrophobia. In the story “The Wind Cave” by Haruki Murakami, the narrator ends up with claustrophobia after his sister’s death. In fact, the entire story revolves around the theme of enclosed spaces. Anything related to the sister of the narrator and her death references an enclosed space in some way. The effect the theme has on our narrator consists of four aspects. The first aspect is about seeing flaws. The second aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent death. The third aspect is about the perception of objects. Finally, the fourth aspect is about how enclosed spaces can represent adventure. 
            The narrator’s sister was born with a heart defect. The heart is inside our bodies and therefore within a closed space. We cannot see the heart and so that is why the narrator “imagined the heart inside” (1) the chest of his sister. We cannot visibly see any defects to the naked eye, but this does not change the fact that from the narrator’s perspective, “within that chest, my sister’s heart was defective” (1). The defects of the narrator’s sister’s heart were so invisible that “even a specialist couldn’t locate the defect” (1). I think that the author is trying to express the idea that when something is enclosed, we will always fail to see the flaws. His sister’s heart was enclosed, so everyone else, except the narrator, must have taken for granted that her sister had no more problems with her heart.  Enclosed spaces destroy our ability to seek help for our flaws because enclosed spaces prevent us from seeing the flawed entity. With this in mind, we can understand why the narrator developed claustrophobia. The narrator must have had a deeper worry of not being able to seek help for his inner flaws. 
            Closed spaces could have symbolized death for the narrator and so as a survival tactic, he would have developed claustrophobia, ensuring that he would do everything that he could to stay away from confined spaces. When the narrator’s sister passed away, “Her large eyes were closed forever” (2). So, this means that having eyes behind eyelids that would never to open again symbolized death for the narrator. The narrator’s sister “was in a coffin” (2), which, from the perspective of our narrator, could have been thought of as nothing more than a “cramped, confining box” (2) where a dead body goes. Later on, the author would get trapped in the back of a truck and tries to convince himself that he would not suffocate. The “logic didn’t work” (5) however and the author was scared that he would also end up like his “little sister, crammed into a tiny coffin” (5). If the narrator ended up in a coffin, it would also mean that he was dead. As a basic survival tactic, he was determined to get out of the truck as soon as possible. The narrator states in the story later on that “death had crawled out of that cave” (12), as if the idea of death itself lived in a confined space. To the narrator, this means that death’s habitat was any small space and that claustrophobia would have meant avoiding death and its habitat. 
            Perceiving objects as enclosed spaces is another effect the theme of enclosed spaces has on our narrator. The two examples of this are the room in which the coffin was located and his sister’s room. The room of his sister’s coffin had “flowers that had been snipped and stuck in vases” (2) and a “speaker set into the ceiling” (2). The room itself was a “narrow room…and was drained of color” (2). We see that each of the objects had been confined to a small area by a certain entity. The flowers were kept in the vase. The speaker was kept in the ceiling. The room was small and was dull indicating that the there was an feeling of emptiness. From the narrator’s description of these objects, we know that he saw these objects as being trapped in an enclosed space.

            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author.

This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill.

The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to.

            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt.

The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort.

The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to.

            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt.

The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort.

The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to.

            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt.

The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort.

The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to.

            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt.

The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort.

The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to.

            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt.

The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to. 
            The author found it more difficult to interact with the women from her village as she grew older. Part of the reason is because she grew closer to her grandmother. The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort.

The author states that her “grandmother has welded me so close to her that the village girls no longer dare to make friends with me, perhaps for fear of rupturing this close union” (1728). In other words, the author grew so close to her grandmother that she missed out on making friends with the other women in the village. Since no one else accepts the author as a potential friend anymore, going to the big city, where the swimming pool is located is her next best choice. Because if she cannot make friends in her own village, her thought process was that she could go to the swimming pool, swim with the people there, and maybe make new friends with the people there. 
            We know that from the paragraph before the previous paragraph that the author was born into tough and sweaty circumstances. This is perhaps the reason why the author develops an obsession with the sea which she was now determined to fulfill. From her perspective, the author saw the sea as a bunch of cold water that was very scarce in the area where she grew up. The author states that she “went back to my dreams, to the sea” (1729) after she leaves a question from her grandmother unanswered. This implies that she regards her dreams and the sea to be at the same level. We can see here that the sea is something that gives her comfort. The sea is in fact a part of the author’s dreams as “the thought of its waters would not leave me, would not be erased from my dreams” (1731). Her love of the sea is very strong and provides a level of escapism that is begged by the author “because there’s no escape for me from the South” (1732). 
            For many of us, going swimming may not seem like a wild fantasy that would defy conservative cultural norms but rather just a leisurely activity. This was certainly not the case for the author. 
            Some people like to go swimming on a hot summer day. But what if you feel restricted? Not because of work or school or other plans but rather because of cultural restrictions. This is exactly how the main character in “The Women’s Swimming Pool” by Hanan Al-Shaykh felt. I think that there are three main reasons why the author was so determined into getting in the swimming pool. The first reason is because she wanted freedom from outside the place she grew up. The second reason is because she wanted to make new friends. The third reason is because she had an obsession with the sea which she would have done whatever to fulfill. 
            The author is from a conservative part of the country where there is not much freedom for women. She states, “that I had been born amidst dust and mud and the stench of tobacco” (1729), implying that where she comes from a rural and agrarian area. This also implies that since birth, working the ground had been a part of her livelihood since the day she was born. If you were born into the sweaty and soil filled environment of the farm and knew of a swimming pool, would you have liked to go to the swimming pool? Add on top of this the fact that the author was living in the heat and sweat “from the harsh sun” (1728) through which she “still had to wear that dress with long sleeves” (1730). Despite the heat, the author still could not show off some skin unlike women in other freer parts of the world. She could not do it, not out of individual choice, but because her religion and culture did not allow her to.
